// Numbers Game #22-style ball/strike lanes beside the diamond: two thin
// vertical columns — a light "ball" lane and a shaded "strike" lane (strikes,
// fouls, and balls in play, the last shown as X). Each lane lists its pitches'
// 1-based numbers stacked from the TOP independently, so a strike on the 4th
// pitch sits at the top of the strike lane even if the first three were balls.
// Filed here rather than in playbyplay/ because it is a drawn scorebook mark
// like PlayDiamond and StrikeZone, not one of that bucket's notification cards.
// `ladder` arrives already built by the caller (api/playbyplay.js's pitchLadder,
// reveal-only): this file decides nothing about what may be shown, same footing
// as every other drawing in this bucket.
